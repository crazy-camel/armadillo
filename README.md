# Armadillo

A next generation content management system (CMS) with an old school flare.

## The story

A few months back there was an inspiring story about how Larry Wall quest for[Perl to be the 100 year old language](https://thenewstack.io/larry-walls-quest-100-year-programming-language/).
This story had me thinking about all the great content management systems I have worked with over the years, and how the internet is in constant flux with new ideas and technology stacks.
From this I had a small idea to create yet another CMS to add to this flux.

## Why "Yet Another CMS"?

With so many out there to chose from I wanted to trying something slightly inverted from the rest of the internet to see if it made sense.
I have a few guiding principles that I wanted to focus on cause my experiences with CMS are always challenged with a few issues.
This project is a bit really a start of something that I feel will be unique for the internet, but at the same time comfortably famaliar.

## Guiding Principles

In order to make this project a some value, in my experience CMS's tend to have very strong points and noticable weak points. These principles
address all of the strengths and weakness that I have discovered in my time and are in my humble opionon a solid set of principles to
a platform can be valuable to many people/business;

* Easy to install and extend
  * CMS's should not get in the way for people to install and extend with new features.
  Things should just work and the setup fast and simple.
* Simple to scale
  * Web Servers are growing at a fast and cheap rate, so things like IO and Memory are now not as limiting and can
  be scaled with simple button clicks. This CMS should be easy to scale and have simple formulas to ensure
  proper functioning.
* Minimal memory management
  * The internet main protocols are still stateless by design so CMS should focus on fast and stable IO processes
  and fire and forget type of functional design.
* SOLID principles with a functional twist
  * SOLID for OOP is a great way to ensure minimal code for maximum flex. Many notable framworks like [laravel](https://laravel.com)
  leverage this mindset well. This should be core to everything in my humble opinion.
* DRY principle
  * Lets face it, it is just cleaner and simpler to not repeat yourself
* A modest and stable technology stack
  * There are simply too many flavours now a days popping out, and it is hard to keep up with. While I am not opposed
  to innovation and embrace it often, for fundemental things like CMS's sometimes changing too much can create a certain
  burden on users which tend to create more problems than good. 
* Keep things simple
  * This is my golden rule, go simple or go home
